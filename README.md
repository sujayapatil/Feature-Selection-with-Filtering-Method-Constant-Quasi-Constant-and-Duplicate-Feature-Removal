Features selected using filter methods can be used as an input to any machine learning models.

Univariate -> Fisher Score, Mutual Information Gain, Variance etc
Multi-variate -> Pearson Correlation
The univariate filter methods are the type of methods where individual features are ranked according to specific criteria. The top N features are then selected. Different types of ranking criteria are used for univariate filtermethods, for example fisher score, mutual information, and variance of the feature.

Multivariate filter methods are capable of removing redundant features from the data since they take the mutual relationship between the features into account.
